## About The Project

> [!IMPORTANT]
> I'm glad to announce that this project is available on [Astro Themes](https://astro.build/themes/details/astrolinkhub)! üöÄ

For a while I was thinking about how popular link pages have become, both for companies and individuals. I've never liked the "free" solutions that many companies provide where they self-promote on every page you create.

That's exactly why I created AstroLinkHub! With this template you will be able to:
- Create your very own links page for FREE.
- Use the colors you want and give yourself all the credits for it.
- And most importantly, update it very easily using JSON.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- **Node.js** -> `v18.17.1` or `v20.3.0` or higher. (`v19` is not supported)
- **Visual Studio Code** -> with the [Official Astro Extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=astro-build.astro-vscode).

Personally I prefer using `pnpm` instead `npm` and to install it you can use:

  ```sh
  npm install -g pnpm
  ```

### Installation

1. Clone this repo to your computer:
   ```sh
   git clone git@github.com:MarcosKlender/AstroLinkHub.git
   ```
2. Install Astro dependencies:
   ```sh
   cd AstroLinkHub
   pnpm install
   ```
3. Run the Astro dev server:
   ```sh
   pnpm dev
   ```

## JSON

The best part of AstroLinkHub is that you can modify every aspect of the website very easily, you just have to edit the `index.json` file. This JSON contains the following sections:

- **html** -> Edit language, title, description and favicon (replace it in `/public`).
- **background** -> Use the same color twice for a solid color or use two colors for a gradient color.
- **header** -> Edit your image (replace it in `/public`), name and description.
- **socials** -> Add more icons with your socials URL (see the networks available).
- **featured** -> Highlight links with a background image or color (same as buttons).
- **buttons** -> Add more buttons with your socials URL (see the networks available).
- **footer** -> Edit the copyright and URL of the developer (Made just for you üòé).

### Icons

> [!NOTE]
> You can add more open-source icons from: [Tabler Icons](https://tabler.io/icons)

Just edit the key `network` with any of the following values (case-sensitive):

- AstroLogo
- Discord
- Facebook
- GitHub
- Instagram
- Link
- LinkedIn
- Mail
- Map
- Medium
- SoundCloud
- Spotify
- TikTok
- Twitch
- WhatsApp
- X
- YouTube
